automaker-20101003

This project is meant to automatically create a Makefile. 

For example, given a source file 'test.c' to produce a Makefile that will produce 'test' along with any dependencies:

	$ automaker test.c > Makefile

automaker opens 'test.c' and looks for a comment section of the following format:
                       	
		/*
		%use stralloc_ready;
		%use stralloc_cats;
		*/

	The above would mean 'test' needs to be linked with 'stralloc_ready.o' and 'stralloc_cats.o', and any dependencies that come along with them (as defined in stralloc_ready.c and stralloc_cats.c).  Each file (with an .o suffix) would be added to test's Makefile entry, along with any more dependencies generated after checking the file (with a .c suffix) for any of its dependencies, recursively.   It then outputs a fully functioning Makefile which builds 'test'.

	You may supply more than one main source file.  For example:

	$ automaker test1.c test2.c test3.c > Makefile

	Builds a Makefile that creates executables 'test1', 'test2', and 'test3', linking them with all necesary dependencies.
