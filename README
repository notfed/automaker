automaker-20101003

This project is meant to automatically create a Makefile. It works like this: 

	$ automaker *.c > Makefile

	it keeps a critbit tree of module names and starts with main:

main() {
	automaker loops through all the named files, opening them one at a time and reading through them (only the first few lines, usually)
	it takes the file name, strips the suffix, and does this:

  loop() {
	adds the stripped file name and adds it to the tree
	it opens the file, makes sure the first line equals "/*", and scans each line up to "*/"
	for each scanned line of the form "%use ${NAME};",
            we assume ${NAME} is the name of a .c file WITHOUT the file extension
	it then repeats the same process to that file with a .c file extension

	
	for(;;) {

	it then scans for a newline character, followed by 
                          the string "%use ", followed by 
                          the *module name*, followed by a ";"
	it then adds the module name to the critbit tree of modules
	it then calls
	if the next two characters are "*/", break;

	}

	automakefile opens somefile.c and looks for a comment header and looks for a list of dependencies :
                       	
		/*
		%use stralloc_ready;
		%use stralloc_cats;
		*/

	The above example would mean the source code expects to be linked with modules stralloc_ready and stralloc_cats.  Each file (with an .o suffix) would be added to somefile's Makefile entry, along with any more dependencies generated after checking the file (with a .c suffix) for any of its dependencies, recursively.  


We will first make tools that this project might consist of:

	A tool to list all the direct dependencies for a specific C file:

		$ automaker-list somefile.c
		stralloc_ready stralloc_cats

	A tool to list all the recursive dependencies for a specific C file:

		$ automaker-list -r somefile.c
		stralloc_ready stralloc_cats stralloc_copyb.c
		$ automaker-list -rc somefile.c
		stralloc_ready.c stralloc_cats.c stralloc_cats.c
		$ automaker-list -r somefile.c
		stralloc_ready.o stralloc_cats.o stralloc_cats.o


	This 
	It will compile a list of objects that this
